# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

I go by the name [Eireon](https://github.com/Eireon), and I'm a software developer with expertise in multiple programming languages. Languages that I am fluent in include Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Python, Ruby, C, C#, and C++. This diverse skill set allows me to approach problem-solving with a versatile mindset and take on a wide range of projects.

## My Interests

### Cryptography

Cryptography has always fascinated me. The art of designing and breaking codes is both intellectually challenging and intriguing. I enjoy not only development of new algorithms, but also researching methods of cracking or weakening already existant algorithms.

### Code Obfuscation

Code obfuscation is another aspect of coding that I find captivating. I enjoy concealing the true intent and logic of a program while ensuring it functions correctly.

## Get in Touch

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who share a passion for coding, cryptography, and code obfuscation. Feel free to explore my projects, open issues, or submit pull requests.
